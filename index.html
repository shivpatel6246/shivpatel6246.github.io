        <h2>Projects</h2>

        <h3>Tactile Sensing Finger Pads</h3>
        <p class="meta">Persona AI | Oct 2025 - Dec 2025</p>
        <p>Spearheaded the development of Persona's first tactile sensing solution. Utlizing magnetic sensing with magnets embedded in a compliant finger pad material with an grid of magnetometer sensors underneath. A normal or shear force will displace the magnet inside the fingerpad which will change the magnetic flux density seen by the magnetometer sensors in 3D. Sensor used differential signaling to eliminate common mode noise seen by the magnetometers in noisy EMI environments the robot would be in such as welding. Owned entire stack from PCB design, mechanical design of the fingerpad, calibration procedure and developed a neural network to capture the nonlinearities in the system and map input force to magnetometer readings. Got the NN running inference on a Raspberry pi at 80 hz, validated real time noise cancellation and accurate sensing. </p>
